# Spec-Driven Development

## Overview

Write a structured specification before writing any code. The spec is the shared source of truth — it defines what we're building, why, and how we'll know it's done. Code without a spec is guessing.

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or feature
- Requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- The change touches multiple files or modules
- About to make an architectural decision
- Task takes more than 30 minutes to implement

**When NOT to use:** Single-line fixes, typo corrections, unambiguous and self-contained changes.

## The Gated Workflow

```
SPECIFY ──→ PLAN ──→ TASKS ──→ IMPLEMENT
```

Do not advance to the next phase until the current one is validated.

### Phase 1: Specify

Surface assumptions immediately before writing any spec content:

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. This is a web application (not native mobile)
2. Authentication uses session-based cookies (not JWT)
3. Database is PostgreSQL (based on existing Prisma schema)
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

**Write a spec covering:**
1. **Objective** — What and why? Who is the user?
2. **Requirements** — Functional + non-functional
3. **Design** — Architecture, data model, API contracts
4. **Edge cases** — Error states, failure modes
5. **Open questions** — What's not decided yet

### Phase 2: Plan

Break the spec into implementable units. Map dependency graph.

### Phase 3: Write Tasks

Each task: Description → Acceptance Criteria → Verification → Dependencies → Files

### Phase 4: Implement

One task at a time, following the spec. Update spec if implementation reveals gaps.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Assumptions surfaced and validated
- [ ] Spec covers: objective, requirements, design, edge cases
- [ ] Plan maps dependency graph
- [ ] Tasks have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Implementation follows spec order
- [ ] Spec updated if gaps found during implementation
